## Blind Runner Game ##

Blind Runner is a audio-based game for Android with an narrator that allows blind people to play. The goal of the game is to escape from a monster in a dark labyrinth, following the direction of the sounds and of your steps.

This game was developed in 2013 by Yago Dorea, Guilherme Bordignon and me (Liuri Loami), but we never finished it. It is working, but there are some bugs to be fixed. 

We published a beta version of this game on Google Play when we were developing it. It had more than a hundred downloads and people discussing about it on a forum for audio games (http://forum.audiogames.net/viewtopic.php?id=15040).
